Feel free to make the UI better : )

Normally setup.bat should make a venv and install the few needed dependencies, from then start.bat can be used as well.
Same goes for Linux with setup.sh, and start.sh (chmod +x them beforehand)

If any error should occur, make an environment of your choice (venv, virtualenv, conda), and install requirements.txt with pip -r, then run python app.py.
